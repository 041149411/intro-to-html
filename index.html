            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <img src="images/lw-photo.jpg" alt="Lori sitting at Peggy's Cove" width="500">

            <p>Hello! <strong>I'm Lori,</strong> a first year graphic design student at Algonquin College. I have a previous degree in Psychology and bring various research work experience to apply to design.</p>

            <p>After working in a research, I realized it was not fulfilling anymore. I wanted to be <strong>creative</strong> and produce outputs that were accessible and meaningful, rather than write papers that <em>no one would read.</em> Therefore, pursuing graphic design is a new path in my career journey. I am passionate about exploring various art mediums, dancing, theatre, and motivated to connect and learn about others.</p>
